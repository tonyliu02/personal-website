<p class="mb-10">
I am a third-year student in <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/">ICS</a> department at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about software development and intelligent systems, particularly Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Currently I am a software engineer at <a href="https://www.radgard.org/">Radgard</a> in which I helped develop Radgard's Android application for garden planning and one-stop shopping for garden supplies. Previously, I worked at a startup <a href="https://troicom.com/">Troicom</a> where I worked on two trackers using LTE and Lora technologies. At UCI, concurrent with my academics, I was a research assistant in <a href="https://github.com/Texera/texera">Texera</a> group advised by <a href="https://chenli.ics.uci.edu/">Dr. Chen Li</a>, where I helped develop a web-based collaborative data analytics system. I also developed a student-initiated project <a href="https://shengyuan-lu.com/zotmeal-app-website/">Zotmeal</a>, where I developed an Android app for displaying menus at UCI's two dining commons and providing various assistance for dining on campus.
